# Surfs_up Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the statistics for the temperature in the months of June and December on the island of Oahu in order to determine whether it is viable to open up a surf shop.
## Results
- The mean temperatures of both months are remarkably similar, with June having around 75 degrees Fahrenheit and December having 71
- The lowest temperatures for each month were almost 10 degrees different, with June being 64 degrees Fahrenheit and December having 56
- The June data had almost 200 more data points than the December data.
## Summary
These results indicate that the general temperature doesn't really change too much over the course of the year which is ideal for a business that relies on good weather conditions. An additional queries that should be performed in order to improve the analysis would be determining the average precipitation each month. Another additional query would be to determine the average temperature based on the different locations around the island.
